# Adding new event:

  1. Check the number of the event. We will refer to it as `NUMBER`

  2. Run:
  `hugo new events/NUMBER/index.md -k event`
  it will create a template `index.md` in the: `content/events/NUMBER` directory

  3. if we have extra files, copy them into the same folder  

  4. if you want the event image displayed, it must be JPEG and it must be called `hero.jpg`
  
  5. fill in the correct data in the `index.md`


# TODO:
  * microformats per event
  * Permanent sponsors somewhere
  * Sponsors as a taxonomy per event?
    * Only video sponsors?
    * No sponsors at all?
