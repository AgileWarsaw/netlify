      #        title: "Why Should Most Organisations Ditch Scrum!"
      #        description: "Thanks to HBR, McKinsey and more of those, Agile has become mainstream but is it Agile? I see Agile being used as synonym of Scrum even though Agile is more of an umbrella where Scrum is just one flavour of getting there. Many inquiries show that Scrum is the most used Agile flavour in the world and I’m here to tell you to stop that movement unless you truly mean it. Let me guide you through some basic elements and help you evaluate if you and your organisation should ditch Scrum or not. Help you recognise if you are truly a Scrum Master or rather a Scrum Novice. And much more."

      #        Big organization, the complex product with multiple stakeholders, couple teams collaborating together. Try LeSS challenge in a safe environment. Join a roleplaying game with the most typical challenges faced by big companies.<br>

      #        <strong>2) Responsibilities in Scrum</strong><br>
      #        There is plenty of duties, and responsible decisions to take during delivering the product. In Scrum, we have three roles that must deal with all of this.<br>
      #        How to correctly distribute responsibility and deal with assigned tasks? How is it in your and other organizations? We invite you to the discussion supported by tool Management in Scrum.<br>
      #        In addition, you will have the opportunity to get to know and test an interesting approach to facilitating the meeting.<br>

      #        <strong>3) Cynefin Lego workshop</strong><br>
      #        There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to problem-solving, as the right decision-making model depends on the domain you’re in. The Cynefin model, created by Dave Snowden, explains how to make decisions in different domains, and this game will let you experience obvious, complicated, complex and chaotic systems.<br>
      #        After this session, you will be able to explain why different domains need different decision-making models, identify the domain you’re currently in and choose the right approach to solve your problem.<br>

      #        <strong>4) Vision, Strategy, and Tactics</strong><br>
      #        In other words, how to turn an idea into a valuable product. How and what strategic and tactical tools can we use to maximize the value of the product?<br>
      #        During the workshop, we will learn the basic tools for product development management, ie. Elevator pitch (visioning & strategy), Impact Map (roadmap), and Product Backlog (tactics).<br>

      #        <strong>5) Systems Modelling for Organisational Design</strong><br>
      #        Many organisations are adopting Agile practices, mnay organisations are finding ways to improve but little of them are truly designing their organisations with understanding. Blindly adopting any kind of Agile Scaling framework will result in tensions that require effort and energy that could be used to deliver outcome instead.<br>
      #        Want to avoid this in the future?<br>
      #        Want to get a better understanding?<br>
      #        Want to acquire a tool to help your organisation?<br>
      #        We will guide you through a series of exercises that will generate insights in the organisational dynamics that are in place within a R&D organisation and it's surrounding departments. With that insight you will be able to design a perfect organisation and evaluate existing Agile Scaling frameworks on best fit in order to avoid tensions and maximise impact.<br>

      #        title: "Filtering out bad ideas: how we decide what not to do @Codility"
      #        description: "A lot is being written on how to select features for further development: how to sieve through the ideas, agree on the most promising ones and deliver them ASAP. Not only because you get to select the optimal projects - but also (what is sometimes forgotten) avoid doing things that might drive your developer team far away from where they should be spending their time and effort. Saving resources (time of developers) for the right ideas is just as important as selecting the right ideas in the first place. I would like to show an example of 2 features we have terminated at Codility just before the development phase thanks to research and internal cooperation, saving the company months of work on a feature that might not be the most valuable one at the time. Research methods used: qualitative concept tests (also known in Codility as Pizza Disaster Tests) and quantitative analysis of internal data. Important ingredients of the success: strong Research – Product Manager cooperation, feedback ownership and clear assumptions behind the development (we know what problem it was going to solve)."

Trudno jednak w komercyjnych propozycjach znaleźć zgrabny pakiet uszyty na miarę dla konkretnej firmy. Ustalone pół roku wcześniej z firmą szkoleniową programy szybko się dezaktualizują i nie zawsze elastycznie się negocjują. Kiedy do tego wszystkiego dodamy nowe w organizacji role: Product Owner i Scrum Master oraz założymy, że organizacja chce inwestować w ich rozwój - zapotrzebowanie ilościowe i jakościowe na różne szkolenia rośnie...
      #Jak firma może poradzić sobie z tym wyzwaniem? I dlaczego, zamiast kupować gotowe ubrania ze sklepowych wieszaków, czasem warto mieć firmowego krawca, który zawsze zdejmie z nas właściwą miarę?<br>Zapraszamy do wysłuchania opowieści o pewnej Akademii Zwinności…"
