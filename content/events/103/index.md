ABE15, as usual, is a great place to meet with all that’s Agile: 

  * two days of inspiring and energizing talks, all held in English  
  * Lean Agile Dojo — a day of intensive workshops on practical topics  
  * great people creating unique atmosphere  

All that, combined with awesome venue, mingling networking possibilities and second to none organization creates fantastic opportunity to share what’s best in software development management and creating modern organizations.
