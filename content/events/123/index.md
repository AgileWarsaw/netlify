### Abstract:

SAFe is the clear market leading framework for helping companies to scale Agile. As market leader it has attracted many criticisms including that of being overly complex and hierarchical. Earlier this year, a simpler view of SAFe—Essential SAFe—was created to help even more teams to scale effectively.
In this presentation we will look at:
1. he basics of scaling - what do we mean by scaling and when is SAFe applicable
2. Essential SAFe - what is it and how can it help
3. How to be safe with SAFe - how and when to go beyond the essentials
