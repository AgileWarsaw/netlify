Impact Mapping is a lightweight method for strategic planning in product and project development.

Although seemingly simple and intuitive, many teams fail to get the most out of it because they jump to conclusions too quickly and skip over important discussions.

Gojko will talk about how to avoid common pitfalls and present two innovation games that can help you facilitate impact mapping easily, support innovative ideas and divergent thinking, and help your teams and clients make a big impact through software delivery.
