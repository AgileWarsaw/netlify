ABE17 is a great place to meet with all that’s Agile:

  * two days of inspiring and energizing talks, all held in English
  * Dojo—a day of intensive workshops on practical topics

Thanks to its unique atmosphere, this is the best occasion to network with like-minded people and share what’s best in software development management.
