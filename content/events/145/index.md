Most enterprises fail in their journey towards Agility. There are many reasons, but most fail because of the unbalanced focus on improving IT departments and changing the practices – e.g., implement Scrum, hire Scrum Masters, use Jira, create Backlogs, do Refinements, etc. In other words, we replace a traditional process by an “Agile process” without transforming the underling culture. Agility is about increasing our company’s ability to deliver high-quality business value in an ever-changing market. It is not about using Scrum, Kanban, doing pair-programming or implementing many of the other buzzwords. Let’s face it, without the cultural change: failure is guaranteed. So, stop trying! Or, join us and see how we can use processes and metrics – that traditional organizations like so much - to actually drive the behavioral changes that promotes Organizational Agility.
