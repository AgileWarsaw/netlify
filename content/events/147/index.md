Organizers' note: maybe you should bring your manager along?

And now back to Pete:

The world of work is transforming at an unrelenting pace – product development is increasingly complex and uncertain, the speed of decisions and delivery are escalating at an exponential pace, customers are demanding more attention and responsiveness, and the workforce is entering with new expectations of engagement. Through all of this, 80% of managers continue to believe they are operating effectively with their employees, yet only 25% of employees agree. Something is wrong! Most leaders are unaware of how their own thoughts and actions are working against their leadership objectives. Ineffective leadership fuels the top impediments limiting organizational agility and growth – the fear of losing control, the resistance to change and contrasting values.

Pete illustrates how leadership agility improves self-awareness, amplifies decision-making, improves outcomes and grows organizational resilience and capacity in highly complex and fast paced environments. Through the art of story-telling from his two decades of personal experience, as well as the experiences of other senior leaders with whom he has coached, Pete spotlights six critical mistakes you may be unaware of in your own leadership practice, how they may be working against your intent, and and how to reorient your personal focus to improve your organization’s outcomes.
