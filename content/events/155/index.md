About the talk:

Many talented and qualified people have attempted to come up with a consolidated view of how organizations should be modeled and behave in order to best reap the benefits we now know can be reaped at the team or project level. Terms like “Management 3.0”, “Radical Management” and “Fourth generation Management” are swarming the Internet.

Does the world really need yet another definition? How come we – three humble Scrum trainers from Scandinavia – think we can make a difference? And what is that difference?
