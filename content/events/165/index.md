About the talk:

Many of us are operating in an organization that has a very complex structure and there is a reason for that! This talk is there to explore some of the reasoning behind the structures you are in. We'll end the talk with a kind of fishbowl to explore options to get out of an endless loop of nut-ness.

Audience: everyone interested is welcome
Duration: 1h talk + Q&A
