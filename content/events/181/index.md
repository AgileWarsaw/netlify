We will be trying out a formula which guarantees that every problem (one per person) will be discussed.

This workshop is about self-help and self-support :) If you have a problem and want to talk about it with someone willing to help, don't hesitate and join us :)

The broader context is that we are considering using the formula at AgileByExample (btw the registration is already open https://agilebyexample.com ;), participants will become natural candidates to help facilitate it in October :)


### Facilitators

The workshop will be run by AgileWarsaw community members :)
