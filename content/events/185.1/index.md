People learn best from mistakes. However, it is infinitely better and much less costly to learn from someone else's rather than from your own.

Over the years I have met and cooperated with a lot of unique and different people involved in Agile. I always try to get better and learn from anyone I get a chance to work with. Nonetheless, sometimes the most valuable lessons come in a wicked form of finding out how to completely screw something up.

I would like to share my experiences and lessons with you and tell you what kind of behaviors might make you a lousy Scrum Master. You don't have to commit your own sins to get smarter. You can learn from other's (and my own as well).


### Speaker

#### Piotr Pelcer
I started my career as a Java developer, following my Computer Science & Software Engineering double major aquired in the USA. However, I have been a natural leader to any group of people ever since the kindergarten and I have quickly commited to working with people on quite a large variety of positions and levels over time.

I am not a big fan of giving people labels and titles. Your email footer doesn't make you who you are and is quite irrelevant. If I had to give myself a tag, I'd say I'm "an enhancer". A guy who makes a difference with the help of his agile mindset. I try to live by the rule: "Today I will change the world. A little bit."
