Imagine your professional career could be like walking towards a mountain - your goal in your professional life. Imagine your actions and decisions could lead you towards or away from that mountain. I want to share with you a part of the journey on which I was fired 4 times from 3 companies in 2 years. I hope some of you will be able to take away something for yourself.
