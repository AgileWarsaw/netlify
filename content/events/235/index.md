This year ABE21 will happen online.

We managed to invite amazing speakers and trainers and we planned two full days of talks happening on two virtual stages with live Q&A sessions. To allow more contact with the speakers we decided to leave few minutes for the Q&A after each talk.

There will be many networking opportunities, as well as thematic chat discussions.

Keynote of ABE 2021: Roman Pichler, Jeff Liker, Janet Gregory, Geoff Watts
