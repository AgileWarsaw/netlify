Many people practice the Agile approach in software development. Some others use it in HR, marketing or even teaching. During our presentation we would like to explain how Scrum can be applied in the environment where you have a tangible, physical product like a robot. We will talk about our culture, experimental and data-driven approach. There is a lot of Evidence Based Management in our daily work. If you have never thought about your job as a scientific research, full of unexplored hypotheses, come and listen to our talk! Maybe changing your perspective will help you? Hope to see you there!

## Who is this event for?

Anyone interested in Agile and Scrum, especially those who’d like to hear about challenges in hardware design and creation.
