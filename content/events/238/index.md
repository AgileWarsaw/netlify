Many organizations seem to be consumers of agile, using it as a method to achieve better business outcomes. However, implementing it just as an immediate response to problems without a defined internal culture might cause exclusion and inequity. There is a need for coaches with Diversity, Equity & Inclusion experience who can be placed throughout teams to act as constant mentors, helping teams work in inclusive and equitable ways while also optimizing team and business outcomes.

## The speakers

[Magdalena Cichoń](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magdalena-cichoń-92b71137/) 

I am a social innovator, enthusiastic about diversity and inclusion. Currently, I am part of a team at AgilePMO, developing workshops and consulting services for organizations going through agile transitions. I focus on the aspect of creating an inclusive culture that gives everyone their voice. At Akademia Zwinnej Liderki I support the creation of a networking group bringing together agile leaders and project managers. My observations inspired me to start a social media campaign #włączamagile (#includeagile) which promotes agility focused on D&I.
