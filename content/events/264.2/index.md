Have you ever been at a meeting dominated by two people fighting about who's right? Maybe you wanted to say something and had no space in the discussion? Perhaps you were facilitating a meeting when no one wanted to speak, and the dead silence lasted forever? In my presentation, I'll show you the Sociocratic practice of facilitating discussion in rounds. It will help you run a meeting so that people do not have to fight for their voices and have space to listen to each other.

### For whom is this lecture?
Everyone, specially people facilitating meetings

### Łukasz Adamski:

I am a Scrum Master/Agile Coach with 3,5 years of experience in these roles. In recent months my main focus was self-management transformation, in which I got to know Sociocracy. I discovered that I believe in its values of effective collaboration and an inclusive environment. I especially fell in love with round discussion and decision by consent.
