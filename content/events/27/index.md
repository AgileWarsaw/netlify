Tom was available because he was visiting the CEE–SPI ALM 2011 Conference.

It seems the CEE–SPI stood for: Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) — Software Process Improvement (SPI) and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)

The talk at Agile Warsaw was described like this:

> Tom gave spectacular speech on Monday's meeting of AgileWarsaw. Tom made Agile look like a toy and Prince 2/PM BOK/RUP like bureaucratic nonsense.
