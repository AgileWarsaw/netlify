"Empowerment Unleashed: Pioneering Agile Evolution with Scrum Masters at the Helm"

Scaling Agile without losing flexibility – an ART to Solution Train case study.

This is a story of empowerment. In this meetup, we present the story of a learning organization and how it adapted from a prescriptive framework (SAFe) to a fit-for-purpose one. To create that, we used the muscle that we had – a group of 10 SMs, one Agile Coach and one Release Train Engineer. We developed our own framework with our own rules and methods and we are still learning from it.
We feel the need to share our story that SMs can create and support change in a huge corporate machine. If you work in a complex corporation this meetup is for you. Come and listen to our story, get inspired, exercise that big brain of yours together with us.

PS. of course we'll use Liberating Structures, it's our tradition.
