# Abstract:

Totaljobs Group adopted Scrum across its Technology function at the start of 2009, representing a huge process and culture shift across the company. Since then we've continually sought to evolve our Agile model, often employing an experimental or iterative approach to key aspects of delivery and quality management. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we don't.

This session aims to share our experiences, experiments and learnings in two key areas: Measurement (how are we doing? how do we know?) and Motivation (creating opportunity to innovate and influence). There will be a presentation and interactive discussion.
