This emotional rant will go through one of flawed yet ubiquitous management concepts we face in our organizations — optimizing utilization. This idea, rooted strongly in twentieth century management, is still embraced very commonly, even when the outcome is just having all the people busy.

At the same time our goal should be efficiency as this is what brings value. The problem is the very same thing that gets us busy won't make us efficient.

The questions are:

If we shouldn't pursue utilization how should we optimize our work?
What makes us efficient and not merely busy?
How do we know we are on the right path?

The session will address these questions challenging some of commonly accepted management ideas showing that we often don't use the knowledge we have at hand. Ideas shared in the session may sound counterintuitive so they are reinforced with hard data gathered among different teams across the industry.

The outcome of the session should be a fresh view at how we do the work as well as learning a few ideas how to make our teams more efficient.
